If any of these is not working just create an [issue](https://github.com/MrRobb/Artificial-Intelligence/issues) to let me know (I usually answer in 24h).

## Compiling

If your OS is none of the above or if you would like to compile it yourself just follow the instructions below.

> This is an OpenFrameworks app --> You have to move the src, bin and other configs to your OpenFrameworks environment to make it work (better explained below).

### Instructions

1. Go to [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and download the proper one for your OS.
2. **Follow their instructions** to completely install OpenFrameworks.
3. Try to execute the `emptyExample` inside of the `apps` folder.
4. If its working, **go to 5**. Else you need to **check step 2**, you're missing something.
5. Create a copy of the `emptyExample`.
6. Move **all the content** of this folder into the copy folder.
7. Try to run it as you did with the `emptyExample` one (in step 3).
8. If its not working create an [issue](https://github.com/MrRobb/Artificial-Intelligence/issues) to let me know (I usually answer in 24h).
