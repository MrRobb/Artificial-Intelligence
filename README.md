# Artificial-Intelligence

Every project has its own README.md with their compiling, running, downloading information.

So, what are you waiting for? Chose one folder!

### Pull requests are always welcome

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to
process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be
discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you
received feedback on what to improve.
